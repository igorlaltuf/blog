My name is Igor Laltuf, I'm an economist and currently I work with data analysis on intermediary cities of socio-bioeconomic development in the Brazilian Amazon using the R language. I'm finishing my master's degree in urban and regional planning at IPPUR-UFRJ and my research is about the BRT system in the city of Rio de Janeiro. At the university, I am part of the CiDiMob (City, Law and Mobility) and ETTERN (State, Work, Territory and Nature) laboratories.
